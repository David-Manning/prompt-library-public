### Academic Reference Extractor

* Takes a reference list from a book or journal article and converts it into JSON (so it can be converted into BibTeX or a dataframe or spreadsheet).
* Will provide what information it can but this is sometimes incomplete, especially on very old articles which pre-date DOI (introduced 2000) or ISBN (introduced 1970).
