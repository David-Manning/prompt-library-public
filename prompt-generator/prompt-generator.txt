Your task:
Create a TRACI format prompt from a freeform prompt. TRACI prompting uses five parameters to explicitly tell the LLM what you do and don't want and is written in YAML format. 
Fill in the gaps in the original prompt with what you think is sensible.
Correct any factual errors as long as it doesn't change the meaning. I may be vague with what I want but you should make this more precise.

About TRACI prompts:
There are five elements to TRACI prompting:

* Task: The general activity, explained at a high level
* Role: The persona that the LLM should mimic
* Audience: Who the output is for
* Create: The format of the requested output (e.g. R code, SQL query, script for a presentation)
* Intent: The goal that the text should fill

Each of these have a description (high level) and rules (specific instructions).
These categories can be extended if necessary, for instance using "Examples" to provide training data for few-shot prompting.
