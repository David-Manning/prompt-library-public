## Prompt Generator

* Turns freeform prompt into TRACI prompt.
* Fills in gaps for you if your original prompt doesn’t contain enough information and corrects vague language.
* You will get a better quality output more quickly if you give it more information up front, but you do not have to carefully structure your thoughts.
* The prompt will not ask you to clarify anything and will go straight to what it thinks you wanted.
* Paste this prompt into a new chat, enter your freeform prompt at the bottom, and the LLM will convert it into a detailed TRACI prompt.
* Output may need checking because it may fill in the gaps in ways you didn’t want. You may want to give penalising phrases.
* You can follow up with a new lazily written prompt like now do "explain tort law" and it will maintain the same quality of output.
